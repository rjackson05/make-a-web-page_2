  This can be done by using elements and class<br>
  There are 3 methods to write CSS<br>
  Method 1: Write CSS into the HTML by adding: head element and style elements.  This is used for small projects<br>
  Method 2: Link HTML to a seperate CSS file.  This adds additional steps but works well in larger projects.<br>
  Method 3: Write style inline with your HTML by coding each individual HTML element.  This approach can cause a lot of repeated code.<br>

  Each tag has a style tag<br>
  You can also set rules that override
